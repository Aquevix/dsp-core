		<p class="lead">Welcome to the DreamFactory Admin Console!</p>

		<p>This console is designed to allow you to create and manage nearly all of the back-end services of your project. You can create new applications, manage users, assign roles, create schemas, and/or connect to external services. You are then free to build a front-end, or client, application that utilizes those services. If you're ready, let's get started!</p>
		<br />

		<p class="lead">Choose an Application ID</p>

		<p>The first thing you must do before writing your application's code is to assign it an application ID. This ID will also serve as your
			<strong>API key</strong> when making API calls to your DSP&trade;. You can fill in the description and a more user-friendly name later. But for now, you must pick a name that contains only the letters A-Z, numbers 0-9, underscores, and dashes. Periods and other characters are not allowed. The reason for this is because this moniker will be used as part of your REST API call's URL. Therefore it must adhere to valid URL conventions.
		</p>

		<div class="col-xs-3">
			<input type="text" class="form-control col-sm-5" data-ng-model="app.api_name" placeholder="Your Application ID">
		</div>

		<div class="form-group" style="clear: both;padding-top: 15px;">
			<p class="lead">Application Type</p>

			<p>The next step is to let the system know what <strong>type</strong> of application you're building.</p>

			<p>Currently you can build applications that are web-based or for native mobile devices. Web-based applications typically run in a browser and use (but are not limited to) HTML5 and Javascript. Native applications, on the other hand, are compiled packages that run directly on the target mobile device.</p>

		<p class="lead">Where Will You Develop?</p>

		<p>Some developers prefer to edit their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code on their local computers, then deploy the package to DreamFactory Services Platform&trade;. In certain situations, this option can make debugging simpler, and allows use of common desktop development tools. Other prefer to edit hosted application code directly from the Admin Console. This allows you to run and test your application immediately, on-the-fly. You can always switch back and forth between these methods as needed.</p>

			<p>Your application's back-end has been successfully created. The next section explains how to obtain the latest DreamFactory Javascript SDK. There is also a
				<strong>README</strong> inside the SDK package with additional applicable information. </p>

			<p>You can return to the
				<strong>Admin Console</strong> at any time to explore the other available features of your DSP. This includes, but is not limited to, managing users, creating and assigning roles, creating and managing schemata, and wiring up external services!
			</p>

			<p class="lead">Download the SDK!</p>

			<p>The
				<strong>DreamFactory Javascript SDK</strong> is a convenient wrapper for the entire DreamFactory Services Platform&trade; REST API. The SDK automatically contains your REST endpoint(s) and
				<strong>API key</strong> so you can get coding immediately. When a new service is provisioned from the Admin Console, the Javascript SDK will
				<strong>automatically</strong> be rebuilt to include the new service the next time your application is loaded.</p>

			<p>Access to the SDK is provided by the Javascript <code>df</code> object. The <code>df</code> object is a property added to the DOM's
				<code>window</code> object. To see this in action, using Chrome's Developer Tools, open the console and start typing
				<code>window.df.apis</code>. This will display all the methods and properties of the <code>df</code> object.</p>

			<p>Your DSP's REST API accepts (and subsequently returns) data in either JSON or XML format. The details of switching input/output formats is explained in the
				<strong>API / SDK</strong> tab. That tab brings up the known and/or available services with detailed documentation, example code, and a
				<em>live</em> testing system. There are also examples for iOS and Android at <a href="http://www.dreamfactory.com/developers/examples"
					target="_blank">http://www.dreamfactory.com/developers/examples</a>.</p>

			<p class="callout highlight-block">Use of the SDK on the local file system requires your list of allowed hosts to be open (i.e. "*"). This setting is available in the
